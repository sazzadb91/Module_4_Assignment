/*You are working on a project to create an online shopping cart system. 
As part of the project, you need to implement a Product class that represents a product in the system. 
The Product class should have the following properties:

- id (integer type): the unique identifier of the product
- name (string type): the name of the product
- price (float type): the price of the product
In addition to the properties, the Product class should also have the following methods:
1. __construct: a constructor method that takes the id, name, and price as parameters and initializes the corresponding properties of the object.
2. getFormattedPrice: a method that returns the price of the product formatted as a string with two decimal places.
3. showDetails: a method that prints the details of the product (id, name, and formatted price) to the console.*/
class Product {
  
    private $id;
    private $name;
    private $price;
    

    
    public function __construct($id, $name, $price) {
        $this->id=$id;
        $this->name=$name;
        $this->price=$price;
    }


    public function getFormattedPrice(){
        return '$' . number_format($this->price,2);
    }


    public function showDetails(){
  echo "Product Details:\n";
  echo "-ID: $this->id\n";
  echo "-Name: $this->name\n";
  echo "-Price: {$this->getFormattedPrice()}\n";

    }
}

$product = new Product(1, 'T-shirt', 19.99);
$product->showDetails(); 
?>
